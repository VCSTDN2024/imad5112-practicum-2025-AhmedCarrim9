PlaylistManagerApp is a native Android application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. 
The objective of this app is to help users create and manage a small playlist of songs they like.
Designed in a simple and understandable way, this app provides a practical demonstration of core programming concepts such as arrays, loops, user input validation, and navigation between activities 
which meet the requirements for this Practicum. Users can add up to four songs, assign a rating to each, and view the full playlist with all entered details.

Overview of the app:
The app's primary screen is clear and easy to use when users first activate it.
They can add a song title, the name of the artist, a personal message, and a rating between 1 and 5 here.
The application refreshes the internal counter to reflect the number of songs added each time the user presses the "Add Song" button and uses arrays to store the input.

Users can access a second screen by clicking the "View Playlist" button after entering four tracks.
The whole playlist, including the details of every song submitted, is shown on this screen.
It is simple to quickly check the music selection thanks to its organized layout.

The application also has a "Reset" option that erases all input fields and lets the user start again in order to enhance the user experience.
Button alignment and placement have been done with care; for example, the "View Playlist" button has been positioned at the bottom of the screen for improved visibility and usage.

This application comes with the tasks required features such as:

 Add Song Details: Users can provide the name of the song, the artist, a rating between 1 and 5, and a comment.

 Store Data in Arrays: The application stores the data for four songs in Kotlin arrays.  Song names, artist names, ratings, and user comments are all stored in arrays.

 Looping for Efficiency: To track and show the songs in the playlist, the application iterates across these arrays.

 panel Navigation: Users have the option to go between the playlist summary panel and the main input screen.

 Input Validation: To make sure all necessary data is recorded, the application looks for incomplete inputs and shows the relevant alerts.

 Reset Functionality: To start over and reset all fields, a clear button is provided.

 User-Friendly Design: For a better user experience, utilize a clean user interface with appropriately spaced items, aligned buttons, and input fields.

 
 This app was created to meet specific goals based off the assesment given. Using The necessary Kotlin and XML files to create the application.

So the first screenshot shows the main screen of the app. What was needed is the Song, artist, rating, comments.
it also has the button to add song to playlist which was required.
it has a button to view playlist.
and a button to exit/terminate the application.

in screenshot 2 it shows all the information added in the respective place ready to be added into the Playlist.

In screenshot 3 at the bottom it shows "song added" which shows you that the song has been added to the playlist and is working correctly.

in screenshot 4 its shows the playlist with all its attributes. it shows the Number of the song, the song name, the arttist, the rating and the comments on that song.
After that it gives an average rating based on the ratings you gave for each song.
Then there is a button to get back to the main screen of the application.
